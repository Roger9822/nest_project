## 📤 Submission Notes

- The NestJS project has been completed as per the given instructions, including the required `/` and `/hello` routes with correct outputs.

- An `index.html` file is added inside the `output` folder to display the route outputs and screenshots.

- This `index.html` file has been successfully deployed on Netlify and the live link is shared below.
